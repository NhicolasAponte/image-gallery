in next.config.js - this is intended to speed up 
the build process, but we do need to make the

    eslint: {
        ignoreDuringBuilds: true,

--- nextjs ---

by default page content is cached on the server  
- to get nextjs to treat a route as dynamic, you can do something

be treated dynamically 
- you can also explicitly make a page dynamic 
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"
